I tried making all the javascript alert/prompt adventures into sweetAlert adventures (which was my intention all along) but there's only ALERT popups in the sweetalert libraries, nothing for PROMPTS yet. however there are things in motion that are requested changes / forked libraries that are waiting to be pulled in which fixes this conundrum of mine.
